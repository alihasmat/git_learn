Learn Git
- install git
- create a folder in desktop, mkdir learn_git
- cd projects to get into the learn_git
- initialise the git: git init
- to check all the files: ls -a
- check what inside the .git folder: ls .git
- create a new file: touch notes.txt
- checking files in git repository: git status
- removing files: rm -rf notex.txt
- add all the files in git repository: git add .
- add inidvidual files in git repository: git add notes.txt
- commit into the git repository: git commit -m "notes.txt file added"
 -m means message
- write inside notes.txt: vi notes.txt
- check what is written inside: cat notes.txt
- after adding some text, check the git status
  your text file has been modified, appears in red color
- add the modified text again, git add .
  git status shows your modified file appears in green.
- if you don't want changes to be made and restore the previous one
  then git restore --staged notes.txt
  type git status, your modified text appears in red.
- but if you want to commit after restore, then add it again
  and git commit -m "notes.txt file modified"
- check all the history of git added: git log
- delete the file: rm -rf notes.txt
- git add . and git commit -m "notex.txt file deleted"
- git log and see the history.
- if you have accidently deleted, added and committed it but you
  want to delete the history log then you restore it using the
hash number(52d4....) of the first commit. I can't just delete
the middle commit because all the commits are chained
- git reset 52d49c43794e407c33578121a108ea11acf2103a 
- git log and it will show only one commit
- what happened to all those commits, now they are
  in the unstaged area. git status, it shows the deleted notes in red color
- what if I want to put all my work somewherelse without
  commit, and whenever I need I will commit those changes
  git stash
- git add . and git status, deleted column appears green and
  then create new file, touch gitlearn.txt and then git stash
